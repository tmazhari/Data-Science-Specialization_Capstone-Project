# Data Science Spacialization - Capstone Project



This repository contains my submissions for Capstone Project of Data Science Specialization offered by Johns Hopkins University through coursera.com.

 In this project I have created a Shiny application called “Smart Keyboard”. The Smart Keyboard lets user to enter a text, processes it in real time and presents three options for what the next word might be.

* **Shiny Application** The Smart Key application is created with Shiny framework. The source code for this application can be found in this repository. 

  

The Smart Keyboard Shiny application can be accessed at:
